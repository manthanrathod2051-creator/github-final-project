# Simple Interest Calculator

This project calculates Simple Interest using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Formula Used

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time period

## Example

If:
Principal = 1000
Rate = 5%
Time = 2 years

Then:
SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100
